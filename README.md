# Optimization-of-Large-Antenna-Arrays-for-RF-Applications
This project was completed under the B. Tech curriculum under the MInor Project by Anu Mishra student of REC, Rewa

The overall flow of the Project is as follows: 

Using MATLAB Antenna Toolbox to design a Antenna array. 

Optimized of Antenna array to maximize the directivity of the Antenna. 

Using Phased Array Toolbox to couple the individual antennas in the array. 

Created an Infinite Antenna Array using similar antenna properties and performed Infinite Array Analysis with Finite array. 

Concluded that the Far field radiation of both the arrays were very similar from -40° to +40°. Later due to the edge effect some different behaviour was observed.

The analysis of E plane and H plane is as follows:

Scan the array based on the infinite array scan element pattern in the elevation plane defined by azimuth = 0 deg and plot the normalized directivity. Also, overlay the normalized scan element pattern.
